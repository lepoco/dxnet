Do this for each different DC and whenever there is a change in the size of the area you want to draw to.To enable the DC render target to work with GDI, set the render target's DXGI format to <see cref="DXNET.DXGI.Format.B8G8R8A8_UNorm"/> and alpha mode to <see cref="DXNET.Direct2D1.AlphaMode.Premultiplied"/> or D2D1_ALPHA_MODE_IGNORE.Your application should create render targets once and hold on to them for the life of the application or until the render target's  {{EndDraw}} method returns the {{D2DERR_RECREATE_TARGET}} error. When you receive this error, recreate the render target (and any resources it created).
