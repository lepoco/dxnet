By creating a render target once and retaining it as long as possible, you gain performance benefits. Your application should create render targets once and hold onto them for the life of the application or until the {{D2DERR_RECREATE_TARGET}} error is received. When you receive this error, you need to recreate the render target (and any resources it created).
