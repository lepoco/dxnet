If font sizes/styles change within an underline, the thickness and offset will be averaged weighted according to characters. To get an appropriate starting pixel position, add underline::offset to the baseline. Otherwise there will be no spacing between the text. The x coordinate will always be passed as the left side, regardless of text directionality. This simplifies drawing and reduces the problem of round-off that could potentially cause gaps or a double stamped alpha blend. To avoid alpha overlap, round the end points to the nearest device pixel.
