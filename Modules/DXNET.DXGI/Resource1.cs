        /// <param name="dwAccess"><para>The requested access rights to the resource.  In addition to the generic access rights, DXGI defines the following values:</para>  <see cref="DXNET.DXGI.SharedResourceFlags.Read"/> ( 0x80000000L ) - specifies read access to the resource. <see cref="DXNET.DXGI.SharedResourceFlags.Write"/> ( 1 ) - specifies  write access to the resource.  <para>You can combine these values by using a bitwise OR operation.</para></param>	
        /// <param name="name"><para>The name of the resource to share. You will need the  resource name if you  call the <see cref="DXNET.Direct3D11.Device1.OpenSharedResourceByName"/> method to access the shared resource by name. If you instead  call the <see cref="DXNET.Direct3D11.Device1.OpenSharedResource1"/> method to access the shared resource by handle, set this parameter to <c>null</c>.</para></param>	
        /// <returns><para>A reference to a variable that receives the NT HANDLE value to the resource to share.  You can  use this handle in calls to access the resource.</para></returns>	
        /// <remarks>	
        /// If you  created the resource as shared and specified that it uses NT handles (that is, you set the <see cref="DXNET.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedNthandle"/> flag), you must use CreateSharedHandle to get a handle for sharing.  In this situation, you cannot use the <see cref="DXNET.DXGI.Resource.GetSharedHandle"/> method because it will fail.  Similarly, if you  created the resource as shared and did not specify that it uses NT handles, you cannot use CreateSharedHandle to get a handle for sharing because CreateSharedHandle will fail.You can pass the handle that  CreateSharedHandle returns in a call to the <see cref="DXNET.Direct3D11.Device1.OpenSharedResourceByName"/> or <see cref="DXNET.Direct3D11.Device1.OpenSharedResource1"/> method to give a device access to a shared resource that you created on a different device.CreateSharedHandle only returns the NT handle when you  created the resource as shared (that is, you set the <see cref="DXNET.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedNthandle"/> and <see cref="DXNET.Direct3D11.ResourceOptionFlags.SharedKeyedmutex"/> flags).Because the handle that  CreateSharedHandle returns is an NT handle, you can use the handle with CloseHandle, DuplicateHandle, and so on. You can call CreateSharedHandle only once for a shared resource; later calls fail.  If you need more handles to the same shared resource, call DuplicateHandle. When you no longer need the shared resource handle, call CloseHandle to close the handle, in order to avoid memory leaks.The creator of a shared resource must not destroy the resource until all entities that  opened the resource have destroyed the resource. The validity of the handle is tied to the lifetime of the underlying video memory. If no resource objects exist on any devices that refer to this resource, the handle is no longer valid. To extend the lifetime of the handle and video memory, you must open the shared resource on a device.
